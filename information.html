            <h2>Follow me on my journey </h2>
            <p>Welcome to my resume website! I'm excited to share my story and professional journey with you. Born in Stockport, England, after 6 months I moved to Florida, where I began playing soccer and learning what it means to be a kid. At 13, I started my first job as a licensed soccer referee, learning early on the values of dedication and discipline. I gained more life lessons through Boy Scouts and waking up early to be a lifeguard.</li>

                <p>In high school, I moved to Illinois, where I explored various hands-on skills, from welding to leatherworking to woodworking. This was also when my passion for flying and future career opportunities began to take shape. I joined Civil Air Patrol (CAP), where I honed my confidence, leadership skills, and earned FEMA and EMR certifications.</li>

                <p> After graduating high school in 2021, I pursued higher education at Lewis University and joined AFROTC at Det 195. There, I refined both my leadership and followership, achieving multiple awards.</p>
